Creating a combined application with both the text editor and the calculator will require setting up a main window where you can switch between the two functionalities using tabs or buttons.

**Exercise 1: Set up the Combined WPF Application**

**Description:** Start by creating a unified WPF window for the combined application.

**Task:** 
1. Create a new WPF App in Visual Studio.
2. Set the window title to "Unified App" and resize the window to 800x600 pixels.
3. Add two `Button` controls: "Open Text Editor" and "Open Calculator".

**Solution:**
1. Open Visual Studio, create a new WPF App project.
2. In the `<Window ...>` tag in `MainWindow.xaml`, set the properties `Title="Unified App"`, `Width="800"`, and `Height="600"`.
3. Drag and drop two `Button` controls onto the window and set their `Content` properties to "Open Text Editor" and "Open Calculator", respectively.

**Exercise 2: Create UserControls for TextEditor and Calculator**

**Description:** Design user controls for both the text editor and the calculator functionalities.

**Task:** 
1. Right-click on the project, then choose `Add -> UserControl`. Name it `TextEditorControl`.
2. Repeat the step to create another `UserControl` named `CalculatorControl`.
3. Implement the previous steps for the text editor inside `TextEditorControl.xaml` and for the calculator inside `CalculatorControl.xaml`.

**Solution:**
1. Implement the respective controls and functionalities for the text editor and calculator in their respective user controls based on the instructions provided in the previous exercises.

**Exercise 3: Switching between UserControls**

**Description:** Implement functionality to switch between the TextEditor and Calculator when respective buttons are clicked.

**Task:**
1. In the main window (`MainWindow.xaml`), add a `ContentControl` below the two buttons. This will serve as the placeholder for the two user controls.
2. Handle the click event for the "Open Text Editor" button to display the `TextEditorControl`.
3. Handle the click event for the "Open Calculator" button to display the `CalculatorControl`.

**Solution:**
1. Drag and drop a `ContentControl` onto the `MainWindow` and set its `Name` property to "contentPlaceholder".
2. For the "Open Text Editor" button's click event, set the content of the `contentPlaceholder` to an instance of `TextEditorControl`.
3. Similarly, for the "Open Calculator" button, set the content of `contentPlaceholder` to an instance of `CalculatorControl`.

**Exercise 4: Styling the Unified Application**

**Description:** Make the combined application visually cohesive.

**Task:**
1. Ensure a consistent color scheme, font, and layout between the text editor, calculator, and the main window.
2. Add any additional styling or adjustments to enhance user experience.

**Solution:**
1. In `MainWindow.xaml`, adjust the properties for each control for consistent styling. For example, set a consistent `Background` and `FontSize` for all controls.
2. Refine any layouts, spacings, and alignments for a harmonious appearance across the main window and the two user controls.
